# DOM Middle Level


## Task 1 
1. Implement the Low level
2. Add an additional transformer to the RUN button, which fills the created 
table with numbers that are compiled according to the following 
algorithm: "row number" "column number". Example:
![task](/task.jpg)

3. Add a handler to each cell of the table which changes the background 
colour of the cell to any other (or random) when you click on the cell. Reclick on the cell leads to returning the previous background colour.
4. Upload the project.
