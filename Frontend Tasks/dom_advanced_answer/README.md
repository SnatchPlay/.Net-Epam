# DOM Advanced Level


## Task 1 
1. Implement the Middle level.
2. Modify item 3 of the Middle level: apply the delegation approach (assign a 
click on the table cell event handler to higher level container). Predict the 
option that the click will not be on the cell, but on its border.
3. Add validation of user-entered data.
